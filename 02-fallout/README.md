# Challenge
- Change the owner

# How to solve it
- trigger Fal1out() function in the contract

# Takeaway
- previously in solidity version 4, we can use function `ContractName()` as a contructor and a single typo can be a fatal mistake.
- this feature already deprecated now, so use `constructor()` to contruct a contract
